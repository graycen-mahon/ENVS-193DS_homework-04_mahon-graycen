1) How does fish length predict fish weight for trout perch? (across all sample years)

H0: Fish length does not predict fish weight in trout perch, there is no correlation between the two. 
HA: Fish length and fish weight are positively correlated, as fish length increases, so does its length and vice versa.

data <- read_csv("north_temperate_lakes.csv")
